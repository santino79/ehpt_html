          <h2>Why Do Personal Training?</h2>

              <h3>Improve Confidence</h3>
              <p>
              Reduce your negative self-talk and focus on your personal positives as you feel your body and mind change for the better.

              <h3>Build Strength</h3>
              <p>
              Building strong muscles helps build stronger bones, ligaments and tendons, reduces injury risk and makes you feel better mentally as well as physically.

              <h3>Accountability</h3>
              <p>
              Setting realistic goals and getting regular encouragement to help you achieve them over the long term is one of the best reasons to work with a personal trainer.

                <p>
                It's harder for women to lose fat and build the body shape they want. It's even more difficult to maintain those changes over time.

                Our proven female fat loss program helps build the habits in your lifestyle that will drop 
                that body fat and deliver the results you want to see.
                <br /><br />

                <p>
                Lifting weights doesn't have to mean getting big and bulky and gaining massive muscles.
                <br /><br />
                It's about building your overall muscle shape and tone most of all. And getting stronger while you do it.
                <br /><br />
                We will work on your nutrition and move up to lifting heavier weights based on your personal end goals.
